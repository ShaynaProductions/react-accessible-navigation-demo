        <abbr title="Garbage In, Garbage Out">GIGO</abbr>: Since a React
        application is built as a series of parent/child components, it stands
        to reason that the only way to create an accessible application is to
        make sure your base components, those wrapping around structural and
        semantically valid HTML elements, are as accessible as they can be. All
        components used in the Navigation Component have also been used in the
        creation of these example pages.
